This folder contains the requested comparison graphs against state of the art methods. 
Additionally, regrding the scalability, we run the experiments with more agents.

## Comparison Against Other Methods
Table 1 shows the comparison against current state of the art methods.

## Run With More Agents
The Figure "boxplot_8agents.pdf" shows the results of the accuracy of the method with 8 agents. 
The figure "distances_histogram8_agents.pdf" shows the change in distance between training distances and testing distances. This is to show how the agents' policies were tested on different coalitions than the ones used at training time.
